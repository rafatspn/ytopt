This directory consists of examples in pytorch and tensorflow for classifying MNIST datasets. Under the directory pytorch/tensorflow, the directory ytopt includes all scripts
needed to autotune the deep learning application using ytopt; the directory laptop includes all scripts needed to autotune the deep learning applications using 
ytopt-libensemble on a laptop. Note: mnist*.py is the original code under these directories.
