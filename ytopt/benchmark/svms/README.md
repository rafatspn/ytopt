# Using ytopt to autotuning the mixed-kernel-heterojunction based on the original Heterojunction mixed-kernel SVM simulation from the GitHub repo: https://github.com/JennyMa0517/mixed-kernel-heterojunction.


use ytopt to autotune three parameters: mixed ratio (p0), sigmoid_ratio (p1), and gaussian_ratio (p2) for the best accuracy. parameter space is defined in problem.py

To run either of them under the conda environment ytune, just use runs.sh
